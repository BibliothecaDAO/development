# Cairo 1.0 standards

This document outlines the coding standards for the Realms Cairo contracts.

As Cairo is a new language, its tools, best practices, and conventions are still developing. In the realm of blockchain programming (with the exception of Solana), writing secure and correct smart contracts is of utmost importance. However, code is read much more frequently than it is written, and thus should be written in a clear and understandable manner to reduce cognitive load on the reader and improve collaboration.

Adherence to these conventions leads to improved security, easier comprehension, and better collaboration. If you have any suggestions for additions to this list, please open a pull request.
