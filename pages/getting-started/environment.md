# Development

Using a Docker container, either natively or through VS Code, is highly recommended as it offers a more streamlined experience for setting up your development environment.

### 1. Clone the repo

Clone the realms repo using the following command:
```
$ git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/BibliothecaForAdventurers/realms-contracts.git
```
